638, Viral WhatsApp message about 'Army Welfare Fund' is NOT a hoax,"A long message informing people about a dedicated bank account created by the Indian Army to accept donation for the families of Battle Casualties is being widely shared on WhatsApp. In this era of fake news, many readers raised doubts about the authenticity of this particular message. Times Fact Check has found the truth. Here's what the message says: ""Pay only Rs 1/- (Rupee one only). Like never before, the Modi government has started a new scheme exclusively for the Indian Army Battle Casualties and Weapon Purchase. The government has opened a bank account where people can donate funds directly to the Army Welfare Account which will be used for purchasing weapons for the Indian Army and providing facilities for war casualties. People had suggested to the government to open a bank account to collect funds exclusively for battle casualties and purchasing weapons for the army, the Modi government has accepted the suggestion and opened an account in Syndicate Bank, New Delhi for the same. The most attractive feature of this scheme is that people can donate the smallest amount of one rupee. Master Stroke by the Modi government. Our countryâs population is 130 crore, even if 100 crore people (70%) deposit one rupee each, the ministry will get Rs 100 crore/day, Rs 3000 crore/month and Rs 36000 crore/year. Rs 36,000 Crore is greater than Pakistanâs total defence expenditure. We spend hundreds and thousands of rupees on many unnecessary things, if we can spend one rupee for the Army, it can surely make India a super power. The money will directly reach the Defence Ministry for the Army's benefit and war casualties. This is a unique idea to help our Army jawans who have lost their life in battle fields. Come together, show solidarity with our defence forces, para military forces, and CRPF. Join the mission to make India a super power.

Properties have been destroyed. After yesterday's attack on Indian military, Muslims in India are not safe."" TRUTHThe video the Twitter user shared is of a brawl at a five-start hotel in Delhi's Janakpuri during a wedding. This video had gone viral last week and had made headlines. We found a news report on TOI about the incident which also carried the same video. The report said that the incident happened after an alleged argument broke out over serving of stale food during the wedding function on Saturday, February 9.

For instance: The caption doesn't have any direct reference to the deadly Pulwama attack on February 14 or Kashmiri people being harassed, but the comments below this video suggests that people are linking these incidents to the video. The vague caption is misleading. Some users are making minor edits to the caption to make it appear as if it's a video of Indian Army soldiers. The video is being shared by many users and pages: TRUTHA reverse-image search on the thumbnail of the links we get in the search result above led us to a Facebook page called ""Policiales"" that had uploaded the same video five months ago and garnered more than 20 million views. The post has been shared more than a lakh times. From the comments, we could gather that this was some sort of demonstration, but we couldn't authenticate where the video is originally from. The quality of the video is not great but we can make out that the men seen in the video have Asian features and the language is foreign. The video ends with a slide containing two words - ""Terima Kasih"". We did a search on this and figured that it means ""Thank you"" in Indonesian. It is clear that the video has nothing to do with the Indian Army. CLAIM THREEA video showing a truck driver, bleeding profusely, is being shared with a claim that the driver is a Kashmiri man and that he was thrashed by locals in Jammu and Kashmir's Udhampur post the Pulwama terror attack. The caption of the video that is being shared reads, ""Udhampor update. Kashmiri driver beaten by doogri (sic)."" In some other posts, the caption said that the driver was beaten up by Dogras.

The only person executed in India since the Modi-led NDA government came to power is Yakub Memon and this was in 2015.

BUT WHAT EXACTLY DID PM MODI SAY?Speaking at the New India Youth Conclave 2019 held in Surat, PM Modi said what closely translates to, ""Rapes were committed in this country earlier too. This social evil is such that we still hear about such incidents. Head hangs in shame; it hurts. But today, death sentences in three days, in seven days, in eleven days, in a month! We are taking steps to ensure justice to those daughters. And the results are visible. It is this nation's bad luck that TV channels run news about rapes for seven days, but news about the death sentence pronounced is not given prominence."" In Hindi, PM Modi said, ""Faansi"" and it translates to ""Death sentence"" in English in this context, and not to ""Execution"". Modi speaks about how TV channels give less prominence to news about death sentences pronounced in rape cases, and it is clear from this that he was indeed talking about death sentences pronounced and not about executions / hangings.

The report started saying, ""Felling of over 1,000 trees for a temporary helipad for the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the western Odisha town of Balangir has made green activists see red,"" but in the second paragraph, said that saplings were planted on 2.25 hectares controlled by the Indian Railways in 2016, and authorities had to clear 1.25 hectares to make vacant land available to build the temporary helipad. The Hindu quoted Balangir DFO Satpathy (spelled as Samir Kumar Satpathy) as saying, ""The allegation of tree felling is true. No prior permission was sought from us for it,"" and as saying, ""When we asked the Railway officials, they said the land had been cleared for a helipad. From the security point of view, trees were urgently cut down, we were told."" The report also quoted Satpathy as saying, ""We are apprehending that trees between 1,000 and 1,200 have been lost.""

A notice will be issued to the Railways to explain why they did this and with whose permission.â Publications like Scroll, The Quint published reports based on the Indian Express report. Scroll titled the report, ""1,000 trees felled ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs visit to Odisha"". The Quint's report said, ""Hundreds of trees cut to make helipad space for Modi's Odisha tour."" The Quint updated the story on January 15 and changed the headline to, ""No Trees Cut for PM Modiâs Helipad During Odisha Visit: Reports"".

709, Did Rahul Gandhi make a U-turn on farm loan-waiver promise?,"A mischievously-edited video of Congress President Rahul Gandhi makes it look like he has gone back on his farm loan waiver promise made during the recent election-campaign rallies. The video that is going viral on social media platforms shows Gandhi talking about farm loan waiver at two different instances - one, during an election-campaign rally in Madhya Pradesh, and the other during the press meet he held on the election results day, December 11. In the first video, Gandhi could be seen promising farm loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh if the Congress Party is voted to power. He says, farm loans would be waived off within ten days of formation of the new Congress government. The second video is that of Gandhi speaking at the press meet that was held on December 11. Answering a question on farm loan waiver, Gandhi can be seen saying, âFarm loan waiver is not the solution.â A Facebook page that goes by the name â PMO India : Report Cardâ shared the edited video, which also carries text in Hindi that translates to, âSee how Rahul has changed his colours within 24 hoursâ and with âBefore election winâ and âAfter election winâ written below the respective videos. The video has already been viewed more than 3,40,000 times and shared over 13,000 times.",0

The video posted by a Facebook page that goes by the name "" PoliticsSolitics"" has, by now, been viewed 5,73,000 times and shared by more than 21,000 Facebook users.

In the video, someone could be heard speaking in Hindi, saying that the Congress supporters in Rajasthan's Tiwari are using Pakistan's flag in a rally. Here's a close translation of what the man, who is possibly recording the video, said: ""See how Pakistan's flag is being waved at this Congress rally. Look carefully. See how these people are waving Pakistan's flag at this rally. This is your own fault. This is a report from Tiwari / Tihari. Not from anywhere else. I am ashamed to say this to the Hindu brothers in the rally, have some shame. You voted for these people, right?"" However, the video was posted with a caption written in Hindi that closely translates to, ""Islamic flag being waved after Congress' election win. Naive Hindus will regret in the future."" The video was shared by many users and pages with the same caption: The same video is being shared by many Twitter users as well, along with the same false claim that Pakistan's flag was used at this particular rally.

Some users shared these photos with a claim that that these are ""Pakistanâs national flag"" used to celebrate the election of Kolkataâs first Muslim mayor Firhad Hakim. One such post written in Hindi closely translates to, ""People celebrated Firhad Hakim becoming Kolkata mayor by hoisting Pakistan's flags. This is an hour of threat for Hindus."" Same photos were shared on Twitter with exact same caption. For instance: Twitter user @afraoo7, however, had two extra photos and another false claim to add to the above. The user's tweet in Hindi closely translates to, ""Pakistan's flags on Kolkata streets and markets, hoisted by people happy about Farid Hakim becoming the mayor. He used to refer to port area as mini Pakistan. Now, he is going to turn the whole of Kolkata into mini Pakistan. He has renamed 'Haldiram' bus stand as 'Hajj house' bus stand."" There is another post that is being copy-pasted by many social media users. While the posts in Hindi started circulating in December first week, the posts in Bengali began circulating on social media platforms in November third week itself. The post warns people against voting for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) saying the Party will turn Bengal into âmini Pakistanâ. Hereâs a close translation of the post originally written in Bengali:âPakistan's flag can be seen in Domjur in Howrah in West Bengal. Take a good look at this and think before voting for TMC. If you do, you would be helping to turn your area into a mini Pakistan. Pakistan's flag seen in Domjur. Entire Domjur is covered by Pakistanâs flags. A flag can be seen just in front of the Domjur police station. We strongly condemn the police and the administration for this. We also condemn the Hindu MLA of Domjur.

739, BJP spokesperson tweets photo claiming to be that of Tipu Sultan,"Tipu Sultan, a famous ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, is considered a hero by many and a villain by many others. Whether or not he was a tyrant is debated till date, but the facts that Tipu was born in 1750, to Sultan Hyder Ali, and that he died in 1799, cannot be changed. BJP Spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, however, doesn't seem to believe so. If what he is claiming is true, Tipu died at least 27 years later, sometime in 1826 or 1827. We will tell you why. On November 10, as the Karnataka government celebrated Tipu Sultan Jayanti, Upadhyay tweeted a graphic card that shows two photos - a black-and-white photo and what looks like a painting. Here's what he said in the tweet - ""Vote the candidates who support: Uniform education, uniform healthcare, Uniform Civil Code, Hinduism and Hindustan, population control law, Ayodhya Kashi Mathura, one nation one Constitution, one nation one name one flag, lifetime imprisonment to corrupts, seizure of 100 per cent Benami properties.""

The said video that was published on Saturday, October 20, was taken down by the publication, but an article that carried the video is still intact. The article reads, âCould the tragic train accident in Amritsar that claimed nearly 60 lives have been averted if the first train to hit the passengers -- the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU train -- had a top light?"" A clarification was added three days later. It reads,âAbhisar clarifies: The design of the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU shown in the video is not the latest model but this raises a bigger question that even if the model of this train does not have a top light, it does not augur well for the security of the people on the railway tracks.

The people on the track cannot see the train unless it has a top light from a distance.â Showing a video footage of a train he claimed to be that of the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU train involved in the tragic accident, Sharma said that it was because of the ""non-functional top light"" that the driver was not able to see the people standing on the railway track, and in a tweet that now stands deleted, described the tragedy as a ""shocking tale of negligence"". Here's the video of the train Sharma claimed to be the train involved in the accident: Navjot Singh Sidhu claims the train had ""non-functional top light""Congress minister from Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu, whose wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu was the chief guest at the event at Joda Phatak on October 19 evening, targeted the Indian Railways asking how a âclean-chitâ was given to the driver of the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU train involved in the tragic accident in âone dayâ. ""The train was running at a speed of more than 100 km per hour. Some people say the top light of the train was not working. If top light was not there, you cannot get it out of the yard.

792, Modicare becomes target of fake news peddlers,"A message that is going viral on social media these days is spreading misinformation about the world's largest government-funded healthcare programme - Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. For the uninitiated, this programme is the flagship National Health Protection Scheme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and is referred to as Modicare. It was launched by PM Modi on August 15 this year and is set to officially roll out from September 25. The fraudulent post about Modicare claims that people will have to pay Rs 1,324 annually in registration charges to avail the benefits of this scheme. VIRALITYThe fake piece of information is being circulated on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and instant messaging applications like WhatsApp. Take a look at these tweets: Ayushmann Bharat August 15, 2018 * 5 lakh rupees of government and private hospitals can be treated free of chargeâ¦ https://t.co/FAfaU0fh5R— à®à®¿.à®ªà®¿.à®à¯à®¨à¯à®¤à®¿à®²à¯à®à¯à®®à®¾à®°à¯ (@senthilcp) 1537343468000Scheme name: Ayushmann Bharat Start Date: August 15, 2018 Benefits: 5 lakh rupees of government and private hospitaâ¦ https://t.co/aZ4JupmvnM— True Hindusthani (@ani30oct) 153733650600",1

794,red image of Vasundhara Raje claiming she was high on alcohol being circulated,"A photo of Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje sitting on the floor, with her eyes appearing partially closed, is being shared on social media platforms with a claim that the photo was clicked when she was under the influence of alcohol. Among those making this claim is a man named Jitu Mal Gurjar, who, according to his Facebook bio, is a Congress Party worker from Jaipur. Gurjar, in a Facebook post made on September 17, shared the photo of CM Raje with the claim that the chief minister got drunk while resting after the recently concluded Rajasthan Gaurav Yatra event, and said that the photo was clicked inside a hotel in Rajasthanâs Churu district. Here is a screenshot of the Facebook post made by Gurjar - Here is a close translation of what is written in the post - âVasundhara Raje in Churuâs Hotel Shakti during the Rajasthan Gaurav Yatra, high on alcohol while resting.â The same post was made by another Facebook user, whose Facebook handle goes by the name 'Bajranglal Karwasara', on September 16. The same image made its way to Twitter, but with a different claim. Twitter user @khandecor shared Raje's photo saying, ""4,500 government bus drivers are on strike in Rajasthan, but Vasundhara Raje doesn't get free from rallies. In the morning, she attends rallies, at night, she could be seen in Churu's Shaktiman hotel, drunk."" Twitter user @khandecor was also found sharing fake quotes attributed to Rahul Gandhi. The same photo was tweeted by another Twitter user, @ramanswall, but not with the same claim. He wonders why Meenakshi Lekhi, BJP spokesperson, and Vasundhara Raje are batting for a 'Hindu rashtra' when they can't even write in Hindi well. This Twitter user has Rahul Gandhi in his Twitter display picture. Gurjarâs post received over 550 likes and more than 350 shares. Karwasara's post got over 450 likes. The tweets with this photo of Raje did not get considerable traction.",0

When Aurangazeb did not get a response even after 45 days from sending the letter, Aurangzeb, the âsecularâ Mughal king invaded China, did a âsurgical strikeâ on them and captured Kailash Mansarovar in just one-and-a-half days.

Today is September 5, celebrated as Teachers' Day, and such a tweet will mislead people into believing that the incident happened a day before Teachers' Day is celebrated. #ABVPgoons hashtag is being used by many social media users to highlight the instances when members of ABVP, the student-wing affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), have been violent and disruptive and have been sharing news articles, but without suggesting that the incident happened a day before Teachers' Day.
