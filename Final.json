Like never before, the Modi government has started a new scheme exclusively for the Indian Army Battle Casualties and Weapon Purchase. The government has opened a bank account where people can donate funds directly to the Army Welfare Account which will be used for purchasing weapons for the Indian Army and providing facilities for war casualties. People had suggested to the government to open a bank account to collect funds exclusively for battle casualties and purchasing weapons for the army, the Modi government has accepted the suggestion and opened an account in Syndicate Bank, New Delhi for the same. The most attractive feature of this scheme is that people can donate the smallest amount of one rupee. Master Stroke by the Modi government. Our country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population is 130 crore, even if 100 crore people (70%) deposit one rupee each, the ministry will get Rs 100 crore/day, Rs 3000 crore/month and Rs 36000 crore/year. Rs 36,000 Crore is greater than Pakistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total defence expenditure. We spend hundreds and thousands of rupees on many unnecessary things, if we can spend one rupee for the Army, it can surely make India a super power. The money will directly reach the Defence Ministry for the Army's benefit and war casualties. This is a unique idea to help our Army jawans who have lost their life in battle fields.

One such claim was made by Twitter user @rimsha_mengal. The user tweeted a video saying, \"In Video: People of Kashmir / Muslims being badly beaten by Hindus in Chandigarh, India. Properties have been destroyed. After yesterday's attack on Indian military, Muslims in India are not safe.\" TRUTHThe video the Twitter user shared is of a brawl at a five-start hotel in Delhi's Janakpuri during a wedding. This video had gone viral last week and had made headlines. We found a news report on TOI about the incident which also carried the same video. The report said that the incident happened after an alleged argument broke out over serving of stale food during the wedding function on Saturday, February 9. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE:  CLAIM TWOMany social media users are sharing a video with a caption written in Hindi that closely translates to, \"This man was firing at soldiers. See what happened.\" For instance: The caption doesn't have any direct reference to the deadly Pulwama attack on February 14 or Kashmiri people being harassed, but the comments below this video suggests that people are linking these incidents to the video. The vague caption is misleading. Some users are making minor edits to the caption to make it appear as if it's a video of Indian Army soldiers. The video is being shared by many users and pages: TRUTHA reverse-image search on the thumbnail of the links we get in the search result above led us to a Facebook page called \"Policiales\" that had uploaded the same video five months ago and garnered more than 20 million views. The post has been shared more than a lakh times. From the comments, we could gather that this was some sort of demonstration, but we couldn't authenticate where the video is originally from. The quality of the video is not great but we can make out that the men seen in the video have Asian features and the language is foreign. The video ends with a slide containing two words - \"Terima Kasih\". We did a search on this and figured that it means \"Thank you\" in Indonesian. It is clear that the video has nothing to do with the Indian Army. CLAIM THREEA video showing a truck driver, bleeding profusely, is being shared with a claim that the driver is a Kashmiri man and that he was thrashed by locals in Jammu and Kashmir's Udhampur post the Pulwama terror attack. The caption of the video that is being shared reads, \"Udhampor update. Kashmiri driver beaten by doogri (sic).\" In some other posts, the caption said that the driver was beaten up by Dogras.

The DMU involved in the mishap was hauled by a loco that does not have a top light. It has a lookout glass and twin beam headlight below the lookout glass. The people on the track cannot see the train unless it has a top light from a distance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Showing a video footage of a train he claimed to be that of the Jalandhar-Amritsar DMU train involved in the tragic accident, Sharma said that it was because of the \"non-functional top light\" that the driver was not able to see the people standing on the railway track, and in a tweet that now stands deleted, described the tragedy as a \"shocking tale of negligence\".

Some people say the top light of the train was not working. If top light was not there, you cannot get it out of the yard. If top light was working then you can see three km because train had a glass (window) at the front for view,\" Sidhu said on Sunday.
